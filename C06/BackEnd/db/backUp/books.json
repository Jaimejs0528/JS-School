Now reissued in softcover with a new introduction, the book, often mentioned in the same breath as Borges, was praised by Camus and writers as various as Thomas Mann, Graham Greene, Pablo Neruda, Salman Rushdie, and Colm TÃ³ibin. Sabato was an important political figure as well as a novelist, exposing the state terrorism of Argentina's \"dirty war\" while writing about everything from metaphysics to tango. On Heroes and Tombs is his masterpiece. In his obituary in 2011, the New York Times wrote, \"In 1972, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda listed Mr. Sabato among the Latin American writers who displayed 'greater vitality and imagination than anything since the great Russian novels' of the 19th century. On Heroes and Tombs, the story of a young man trying to find his way in life in Buenos Aires, is considered his most important work of fiction. But many people also know Mr. Sabato for his work in helping Argentina heal when democracy was restored in 1983 after seven years of military dictatorship.\" This book is woven around a violent crime: the scion of a prominent Argentinian family, Alejandra, shoots her father and burns herself alive over his corpse. The story shifts between perspectives to reveal the lives of those closest to her, telling of Martin, her troubled lover; Bruno, a writer who loved her mother; and Fernando, her father, who believes himself hunted by a secret, international organization of the blind. Exploring the tumult of Buenos Awes in the 1950s, Heroes illuminates its characters against burning churches and corporate greed. An examination of Argentinian history and culture, it reveals the country at every level, leading its reader into a world of passion, philosophy, and paranoia that still persists.

But just as heâs packing his bags to return to school, a creature named Dobby the house-elf announces that if Harry goes back to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And it turns out, Dobby is right. Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls' bathroom; the strange behavior of Ron's little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the \"Chamber of Secrets,\" a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the Wizarding world, even affecting Harry's friend Hermione. But all of these seem like minor concerns when someone starts turning Hogwarts students to stone: an evildoer said to be the fearsome Heir of Salazar Slytherin, on of the founders of the school. Could it be Draco Malfoy, Harry's most poisonous rival? Could it be Hagrid whose mysterious past is finally told?

He wants to get away from the malicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe do more than dream). And now that heâs gotten the hang of things at Hogwartsâhe hopesâhe just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard. But even by his standards, Harry's year is anything but normal. First Dumbledore announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn't taken place for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic in three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to participate in the tournamentâwhich really means someone wants him dead. Harry is guided through the competition by Professor Alastor Moody, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty reporter named Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply jealous of Harry's fame; Hermione's newfound activism on behalf of house-elves; and the terrifying prospect of asking a date to the Yule Ball. Worst of all, Lord Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials necessary for his rejuvenation... and he has a faithful servant at Hogwarts waiting only for a sign. No, nothing is ever normal for Harry Potter. And in his case, different can be deadly.","numPages":734,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-TE0BgAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=1\u0026source=gbs_api"},"lends":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5c09287aa22a5c2494694919"},"userEmail":"jobman@jobman.com","bookCode":787,"lendDate":{"$date":"2018-12-06T13:47:38.744Z"},"limitDate":{"$date":"2018-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"}}],"__v":0}

Marie Laure lives with her father in Paris within walking distance of the Museum of Natural History where he works as the master of the locks (there are thousands of locks in the museum). When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a model of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with her fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure's agoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. In another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, both enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing radios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, makes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of Hitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path converges with Marie-Laure. Doerr's gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, All the Light We Cannot See is his most ambitious and dazzling work\"--","numPages":544,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=giaLDgAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=1\u0026edge=curl\u0026source=gbs_api"},"lends":[],"__v":0}

Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, and Hermione embark on a desperate quest the length and breadth of Britain, trying to locate and destroy Voldemortâs four remaining Horcruxes, the magical objects in which he has hidden parts of his broken soul. They visit the Burrow, Grimmauld Place, the Ministry, Godricâs Hollow, Malfoy Manor, Diagon Alleyâ¦But every time they solve one mystery, three more evolveâand not just about Voldemort, but about Dumbledore, and Harryâs own past, and three mysterious objects called the Deathly Hallows.

Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how. By using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworksâscikit-learn and TensorFlowâauthor Aurï¿½lien Gï¿½ron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. Youâll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what youâve learned, all you need is programming experience to get started. Explore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets Use scikit-learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-end Explore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods Use the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets Dive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning Learn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets Apply practical code examples without acquiring excessive machine learning theory or algorithm details","numPages":566,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I6qkDAEACAAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=1\u0026source=gbs_api"},"lends":[],"__v":0}
