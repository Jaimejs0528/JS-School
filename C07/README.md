## Setup

First of all, you'll need to run the server [GUIDE](https://github.com/Jaimejs0528/JS-School/tree/master/C06).

NOTE: Don't modify the defaults ports.

After that you have the server running, you must to run, the next commands:
> npm install<br>
> npm run build-prod

Afterward, with mount a server, you can use http-server o live-server.

I recommend use live-server, you can add in Visual Studio Code as a pluging [Live-Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Maybe you need to create a file settings.json and add:

>{
>  "liveServer.settings.root": "C07"
>}

When you have the server installed, run it. And go to dist path.(Here is the index.html).
